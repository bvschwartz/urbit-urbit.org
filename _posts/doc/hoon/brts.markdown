`|=`, `bartis`, `[%brts p=tile q=twig]` is a synthetic hoon that
produces a dry `%gold` gate with arm `q`, sample `[%bctr p]`.

      $%  [%brts p=tile q=twig]
      ==

    |=  p
    q

    |=(p q)

###Expansion###
    
    ++  open
      ^-  twig
      ?-    gen
          [%brts *]

###Notes###

See the bestiary of cores in Chapter 11.

In slang, street or gutter Hoon, `|=` is pronounced `bong`.  But
any serious or respectable engineer will only say `bartis`.
"Lambda" is not an appropriate usage in either circumstance.
